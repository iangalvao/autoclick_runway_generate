# Python Automation for Runway "Generate" Button

This repository contains a simple Python script that automates clicking the "Generate" button on Runway. It uses:
- **[PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** for GUI automation (moving/clicking the mouse, taking screenshots, etc.)
- **OpenCV (cv2)** for advanced image recognition (optional, but useful for template matching)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**  
   Make sure Python is installed. You can verify with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. **pip**  
   Most Python installations come with `pip`. Check with:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/runway-automation.git
   cd runway-automation
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui opencv-python
   ```
   - Alternatively, use a **virtual environment**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install pyautogui opencv-python
     ```

3. Place your screenshot of the “Generate” button in the repository folder (e.g., `generate_button.png`).

### Usage

1. Make sure your Runway window is visible and the “Generate” button is on screen.
2. Run the automation script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   1. Pause for a few seconds (giving you time to switch to Runway if needed).
   2. Locate the “Generate” button on screen using `pyautogui.locateOnScreen`.
   3. Move the mouse to the button and click it.

### Troubleshooting

- **Screen scaling issues**: If you are on a high-DPI screen, ensure Windows scaling is set to 100% or adjust the script accordingly.
- **Confidence level**: If the script can’t find the button, lower or increase the `confidence` parameter in `pyautogui.locateOnScreen` (e.g., `confidence=0.8` → `confidence=0.7` or `confidence=0.9`).
- **Button not on top**: Make sure the Runway window is on top and not covered by other applications.
- **Admin permissions**: Some apps require your script to run with elevated privileges. If clicks are not registering, try running your Python shell as Administrator.

### Project Structure

Below is a sample project structure:

```
.
├── main.py
├── generate_button.png
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

- **main.py**: The main automation script.
- **generate_button.png**: Screenshot of the “Generate” button (the template used for matching).
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
- **.gitignore**: Patterns to exclude from version control.
